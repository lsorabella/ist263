        My name is Lauren Sorabella and I am a student at the Newhouse School of Public Communications studying Magazine and Digital Journalism 
        and hopefully pursuing a minor in the iSchool in Information Management 
        and Technology. My degree in magazine lets me use creative tools while my 
        minor helps in using the technology of making a website, using different 
        editing softwares. I also am part of the Fashion and Beauty Milestone between
        Newhouse and VPA. Outside of school I love to read, listen to podcasts, 
        go on walks, and play with my dog, Brody.
