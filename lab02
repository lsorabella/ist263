        My name is Lauren Sorabella and I am a student at the Newhouse School of Public Communications studying Magazine and Digital Journalism 
        and hopefully pursuing a minor in the iSchool in Information Management 
        and Technology. My degree in magazine lets me use creative tools while my 
        minor helps in using the technology of making a website, using different 
        editing softwares. I also am part of the Fashion and Beauty Milestone between
        Newhouse and VPA. Outside of school I love to read, listen to podcasts, 
        go on walks, and play with my dog, Brody.

            I am from Boston, Massachusetts and it is my<strong> favorite </strong> to be.
            Some of my favorite things to do when I'm home is attend hockey games,
            Boston universities have very competitive hockey teams that are entertaining
            to watch. I also love going in to eat seafood, my favorite type of food, and
            when it's cold some New England Clam Chowder.
