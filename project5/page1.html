<p> Blog Post #2 (category: Book Review) <br>
    8/10 <br> 
    My book of the month this January was Daisy Jones and the Six, the famous Taylor Jenkins Reid novel that is being turned into a miniseries on Amazon Prime Video this March (so my timing was perfect). The book follows the rise and fall of a popular fictional band in the 70s. I loved this book because it was different from anything I’ve ever read in that it was set up almost like a script to a TV show but they’re all just talking to the interviewer giving their thoughts while reminiscing on their prime years. I thought in the middle it started to drag, but it was an interesting read and contributed to my grunge grandma era that I have been in recently. I can’t wait to watch the series and see if it is an accurate representation of the book. Rating on that coming soon!
